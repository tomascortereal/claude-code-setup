# Global Instructions

## Auto-Use Integrations

CRITICAL: You have many plugins, MCP servers, skills, agent types, and teams installed. DO NOT wait for the user to mention them. Automatically use the right integration for the task at hand. Think of yourself as an orchestrator with a full toolkit — pick the best tool BEFORE the user has to tell you.

---

## 1. Code Understanding & Navigation

### Serena (MCP — semantic code tools)
USE WHEN: understanding code structure, finding definitions, tracing references, navigating architecture
- `get_symbols_overview` — scan a file's classes/functions/methods without reading the whole file
- `find_symbol` — locate a symbol by name with optional body inclusion
- `find_referencing_symbols` — find all callers/usages of a symbol (ALWAYS do this before refactoring)
- `search_for_pattern` — fast regex search across the codebase
- `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_before_symbol`, `insert_after_symbol` — precise symbolic edits
- PREFER Serena's symbolic tools over reading entire files. Get overview first, drill into specifics.

### Greptile (plugin — codebase intelligence)
USE WHEN: you need high-level codebase understanding, semantic code search beyond simple grep
- Good for "how does X work in this codebase" type questions

### LSPs: Pyright / BasedPyright / TypeScript LSP (plugins)
USE WHEN: type checking, go-to-definition, completions, diagnostics for Python or TypeScript code
- These run automatically in background — use LSP tool for hover info, diagnostics, references

### Claude-mem Smart Explore (skill: `claude-mem:smart-explore`)
USE WHEN: you need token-efficient structural code exploration using AST parsing
- Better than reading full files when you just need to understand code structure

---

## 2. Library & Framework Documentation

### Context7 (MCP — live documentation)
USE WHEN: working with ANY external library, framework, or package
- Step 1: `resolve-library-id` to find the library
- Step 2: `query-docs` to get current API docs and examples
- Do this PROACTIVELY when you see unfamiliar imports or need API details
- Always prefer this over guessing API signatures from training data

---

## 3. Browser & Web

### Playwright (MCP — browser automation)
USE WHEN: user shares a URL, testing web UIs, taking screenshots, web research, form filling
- `browser_navigate` → go to a URL
- `browser_snapshot` → get page accessibility tree (better than screenshot for understanding)
- `browser_take_screenshot` → visual capture
- `browser_click`, `browser_fill_form`, `browser_type` → interact with pages
- Use this automatically when the user pastes a URL or asks about a web page

---

USE WHEN: executing all plans in a GSD phase with wave-based parallelization

### GSD Quick (skill: `gsd:quick`)

## 7. Code Quality & Review

### Code Simplifier (plugin + agent: `code-simplifier:code-simplifier`)
USE WHEN: reviewing changed code for reuse opportunities, quality issues, efficiency
- Invoke skill `simplify` after making code changes

## Decision Rules (follow these automatically)

1. **User reports a problem** → Serena (code context) + claude-mem (past issues) + systematic-debugging skill BEFORE responding
2. **User asks "how do I..."** → Context7 (library docs) + Serena (existing patterns) + claude-mem (past solutions)
3. **User shares a URL** → Playwright to browse it
4. **Starting any non-trivial task** → check superpowers skills (brainstorming, debugging, TDD)
5. **Making code changes** → Serena's `find_referencing_symbols` to check impact + code-simplifier after
6. **Completing work** → verification-before-completion skill + code-reviewer agent
7. **Multiple independent tasks** → dispatching-parallel-agents or Agent Teams
8. **User references past work** → claude-mem search
9. **Frontend/UI work** → ui-ux-pro-max skill
10. **Complex multi-step project** → GSD skills for phased management
11. **External library usage** → Context7 for docs, ALWAYS
12. **After writing significant code** → spawn code-simplifier agent to review
13. **LLM app observability/tracing/debugging** → Arize skills (trace, experiment, prompt-optimization)
14. **Task has 2+ independent pieces** → PROACTIVELY suggest Agent Teams, explain the split and why it's faster
